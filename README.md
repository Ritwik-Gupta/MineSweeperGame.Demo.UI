# MineSweeperDemoUI

This is a frontend app built using Angular 16 that replicates the famous MineSweeper Game.

This frontend app is hooked with the backend API(built on .NET Core) [github repo - https://github.com/Ritwik-Gupta/MineSweeperGame.Demo.API], which performs that logic of building the grids for the game.

In order to run the app on local environment, you'll have to run both the Angular app and the .NET Core web api.
